1. Implementation Steps:
2. Download the MIMIC-III dataset
3. Extract and preprocess data in MIMIC-III by running MIMIC-Extract
4. Extract first 24 hour time-series features
5. Select clinical notes based on criteria from MIMIC-III notes
6. Preprocess clinical notes
7. Extract medical entities from clinical notes using med7
8. Convert medical entities into word representations with different embeddings
9. Create time-series data to feed through GRU/LSTM
10. Run time-series baseline model to predict 4 different clinical tasks
11. Run multimodal baseline mode to predict 4 different clinical tasks
12. Run proposed model to predict 4 different clinical tasks
13. Compare performance metrics between different models
